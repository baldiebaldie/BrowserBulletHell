# Kinetic Core

An abstract, high-speed Bullet Hell experience focused on modularity and tight controls. Designed for short-session, high-intensity gameplay.

### Design Philosophy

- Abstract Identity: Gameplay over graphics. Use geometric shapes that are easy to see.
- Scalable Difficulty: The user should have the gameplay progressively elevate as the level goes on
- ### Development Roadmap

  [✓] Core: Get all base mechanics working prior to pushing out features.

  [✓] Random mode: Allow for random patterns to allow for a unique experience each playthrough

  [✓] UI: Make a easy to use yet pleasant UI where users can choose to play or customize their character if they wish

  [ ] Patterns: Allow for different spawners to shoot projectiles at variable rates, patters, speeds, etc. to freshen gameplay experience
